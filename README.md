Aims to build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions from a highly imbalanced dataset. The dataset contains anonymized credit card transaction data, with a vast majority of non-fraudulent transactions and a very small number of fraudulent transactions.
The classification report and Accuracy score obtained are as follows:
